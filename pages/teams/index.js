					<p className='my-5'>
						Our association was born from our wish to value real and deep ties,
						horizontality and dialogue, curiosity and welcoming of the
						different. After lots of videocalls, thousand doubts and just as
						many ideas, our team has become a family. We are proud of our
						diversity and passion, enthusiastic in sharing inspiration and in
						continuously proposing new perspectives.{' '}
					</p>
					<p>
						We will be waiting for you in Sanremo, to introduce ourselves
						properly. In the meanwhile, here is an anticipation of who we are.
