                            <Accordion.Body>
                            Scambi Festival 2022 is taking place in the neighborhood of Pigna, Sanremo, Italy, from the 25th to the 28th of August 2022.

                            I already know I cannot be in Sanremo from the 25th to the 28th of August 2022. Will I be able to follow the meetings online?

                            Unfortunately, not. Virtual meetings deny the very definition of what we are working on. Physicality is a key factor in the 
                            human exchange and mutual growth we are pursuing.

                            Canâ€™t wait to be there! Are there any accommodation solutions?

                            <Accordion.Body>
                            It is too soon to know for sure, but we are working on offering low-cost accommodation solution to allow the 
                            participation of everyone, no matter if local or coming from Tatooine.

                            <Accordion.Body>
                            Nothing. Scambi aims to be accessible to everyone, literally: there are no age limits, no activities inaccessible
                            to people with disabilities, and, of course, there is no fee.

                            Last year, they were not. We are working hard to ensure language will not be an
